TurbineDAQ
==========
A Python desktop app for automated turbine data acquisition in the UNH tow tank. 

## Test plan
A matrix of test parameters should be created and placed in the `Test plan` directory.
Each "section" of the experiment gets its own CSV file. See `test/Test plan` for an
example. The test plan, if one exists, is loaded into the GUI at startup. To change, it must be
edited externally and reloaded.

                    metadata.json
                    acsdata.h5
                    nidata.h5
```

## Types of runs
In the `runtypes` module, there are classes to represent each type of run:

  * `TurbineTow`
  * `TareDragRun`
  * `TareTorqueRun`

Each of these subclass PyQt's `QThread`. For future experiments, there will likely be
a `TurbineTowInWaves` or options in `TurbineTow` for wave generation with `makewaves`.
